# Task ID: 1
# Title: Configure Azure AD Integration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the application to connect with Azure AD tenant using the specified IDs and OAuth scopes.
# Details:
1. Register the application in Azure AD portal if not already done
2. Configure the application with:
   - Tenant ID: 3c7fa9e9-64e7-443c-905a-d9134ca00da9
   - Application (client) ID: c67bf91d-8b6a-494a-8b99-c7a4592e08c1
3. Set up OAuth scopes:
   - api://c67bf91d-8b6a-494a-8b99-c7a4592e08c1/Application.Admin
   - api://c67bf91d-8b6a-494a-8b99-c7a4592e08c1/Application.User
4. Create environment-specific configurations in appsettings.json:
```json
{
  "AzureAd": {
    "Instance": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/",
    "TenantId": "3c7fa9e9-64e7-443c-905a-d9134ca00da9",
    "ClientId": "c67bf91d-8b6a-494a-8b99-c7a4592e08c1",
    "CallbackPath": "/signin-oidc",
    "SignedOutCallbackPath": "/signout-callback-oidc"
  }
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify Azure AD configuration in Azure portal
2. Confirm application registration details match the PRD specifications
3. Validate OAuth scopes are correctly configured
4. Test environment-specific configurations load correctly in different environments

# Subtasks:
## 1. Register Application in Azure Portal [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Sign in to the Azure portal with administrator privileges and create a new app registration. Record the Application (client) ID, Directory (tenant) ID, and configure the Redirect URI as required for your application.
### Details:
Ensure you have the necessary Azure administrator role (Global Administrator, Cloud Application Administrator, or Application Administrator). Follow the Azure portal workflow to register the application and note all relevant credentials for later steps.

## 2. Configure OAuth Scopes and Permissions [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Define and assign the necessary OAuth 2.0 scopes and API permissions for the registered application to enable secure access to required resources.
### Details:
In the Azure portal, navigate to the app registration and configure API permissions. Add delegated or application permissions as needed, and grant admin consent if required.

## 3. Set Up Environment-Specific Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Configure environment-specific settings such as client secrets, issuer URLs, and redirect URIs for each deployment environment (development, staging, production).
### Details:
Store sensitive values like client secrets securely (e.g., Azure Key Vault or environment variables). Ensure each environment uses the correct configuration values to prevent authentication issues.

## 4. Implement Authentication Middleware [done]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Integrate authentication middleware in the application codebase to handle Azure AD authentication flows using the registered app and configured OAuth scopes.
### Details:
Use appropriate libraries or frameworks (e.g., Microsoft.Identity.Web for .NET) to implement middleware that manages sign-in, token acquisition, and user session handling.

## 5. Test and Validate Azure AD Integration [done]
### Dependencies: 1.4
### Description: Perform comprehensive testing of the Azure AD integration across all environments to ensure authentication works as expected and security requirements are met.
### Details:
Test user sign-in, token issuance, scope enforcement, and error handling. Validate configuration for each environment and review logs for any authentication failures.
