# Task ID: 1
# Title: Create Entity Framework model class for ROLE_PERMISSION
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the ROLE_PERMISSION.cs class that represents the ROLE_PERMISSION table in the database with all required properties.
# Details:
Create a new class file ROLE_PERMISSION.cs in the Models directory with the following properties:

```csharp
public class ROLE_PERMISSION
{
    public int GUID { get; set; }
    public int GUID_ROLE { get; set; }
    public string PERMISSION { get; set; }
    public DateTime CREATED { get; set; }
    public string CREATEDBY { get; set; }
    public DateTime? UPDATED { get; set; }
    public string UPDATEDBY { get; set; }
    public DateTime? DELETED { get; set; }
    public string DELETEDBY { get; set; }
    
    // Navigation property
    public virtual ROLE ROLE { get; set; }
}
```

Ensure that the class follows the same naming conventions and structure as other entity models in the project.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the class has all required properties with correct data types. Ensure navigation property is properly defined for the relationship with the ROLE table.
