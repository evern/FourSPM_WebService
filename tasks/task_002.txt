# Description: Set up Azure AD configuration settings in appsettings.json with environment-specific configurations.
# Details:
Create an 'AzureAd' section in appsettings.json with the following structure:

```json
{
  "AzureAd": {
    "Instance": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/",
    "Domain": "yourdomain.onmicrosoft.com",
    "TenantId": "your-tenant-id",
    "ClientId": "your-client-id",
    "CallbackPath": "/signin-oidc",
    "SignedOutCallbackPath": "/signout-callback-oidc"
  }
}
```

Create environment-specific settings in appsettings.Development.json and appsettings.Production.json with appropriate values. Use user secrets or Azure Key Vault for storing sensitive information in development and production environments respectively.

# Test Strategy:
Validate configuration file structure. Ensure sensitive information is not committed to source control. Verify environment-specific configurations load correctly by running the application in different environments.
