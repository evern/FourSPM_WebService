# Title: Update ROLE entity class with navigation property
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Update the ROLE.cs class to include a navigation property for the relationship with ROLE_PERMISSION.
# Details:
Modify the existing ROLE.cs class to include a collection navigation property for ROLE_PERMISSION entities:

```csharp
public class ROLE
{
    // Existing properties
    
    // Add this new navigation property
    public virtual ICollection<ROLE_PERMISSION> ROLE_PERMISSIONS { get; set; }
    
    // Constructor to initialize the collection
    public ROLE()
    {
        ROLE_PERMISSIONS = new HashSet<ROLE_PERMISSION>();
    }
}
```

If the constructor already exists, just add the initialization for the new collection.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the ROLE class now includes the ROLE_PERMISSIONS collection property and that it's properly initialized in the constructor.
