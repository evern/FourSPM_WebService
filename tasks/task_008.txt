# Task ID: 8
# Title: Update service registration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Register the role permission repository in the dependency injection container.
# Details:
Update the service registration code (typically in Startup.cs or a dedicated registration class) to register the repository:

```csharp
// Add this line to the existing service registration method
services.AddScoped<IRolePermissionRepository, RolePermissionRepository>();
```

Ensure this follows the same pattern as other repository registrations in the project.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the repository is properly registered by inspecting the DI container configuration. Test that the repository can be injected into controllers and other services.
