      "taskTitle": "Update Startup.cs for MSAL Configuration",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the process of updating Startup.cs for MSAL configuration into: (1) Adding MSAL configuration to ConfigureServices, (2) Configuring JWT bearer options for dual authentication, (3) Registering Azure AD application details, (4) Setting up authority and audience validation, (5) Implementing organization-only authentication logic.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves integrating MSAL authentication into an existing authentication setup, requiring careful configuration of services, JWT options, and Azure AD details. It is moderately complex due to the need to support both legacy and MSAL tokens, but follows established patterns in ASP.NET Core[2][5]."

      "taskTitle": "Create Authentication Middleware",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the middleware creation into: (1) Designing the middleware class structure, (2) Implementing token extraction logic, (3) Determining token type (MSAL vs legacy), (4) Validating and storing token type in HttpContext, (5) Passing authentication info to the next middleware, (6) Registering and testing the middleware in the pipeline.",
      "reasoning": "Developing custom middleware to handle dual authentication requires a solid understanding of the ASP.NET Core pipeline, token processing, and extensibility. The logic for distinguishing and handling both token types adds to the complexity[2][5]."

      "taskTitle": "Update AuthService for Dual Authentication",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Decompose the AuthService update into: (1) Modifying the interface for dual methods, (2) Implementing MSAL token validation, (3) Implementing legacy token validation, (4) Creating token type detection helpers, (5) Ensuring backward compatibility, (6) Writing unit tests for all methods.",
      "reasoning": "Enhancing AuthService to support both authentication methods involves interface changes, new validation logic, and maintaining backward compatibility, which increases the risk of regression and requires thorough testing[2][5]."

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down MSAL token validation into: (1) Implementing detailed MSAL token validation logic, (2) Extracting and validating MSAL-specific claims, (3) Handling MSAL token formats, (4) Authority and audience validation, (5) Integrating with AuthService.",
      "reasoning": "While MSAL token validation follows established patterns, handling MSAL-specific claims and integrating with existing services requires attention to detail but is not highly complex if familiar with JWT and Azure AD[2]."

      "reasoning": "Mapping claims to roles and permissions and integrating with existing database structures is moderately complex, especially when ensuring compatibility with both authentication methods and existing authorization logic."

      "reasoning": "Configuring JWT bearer options for dual authentication involves advanced setup of validation parameters and event handling, requiring a deep understanding of the authentication pipeline and security best practices[2][5]."
