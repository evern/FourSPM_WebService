    {
      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Create Entity Framework model class for ROLE_PERMISSION",
      "complexityScore": 2,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 2,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the creation of the ROLE_PERMISSION entity class into: 1) Creating the basic class with properties, and 2) Adding navigation properties and ensuring proper relationships",
      "reasoning": "This is a straightforward task involving creating a simple entity class with standard properties. The code is already provided and follows a common pattern. Low complexity due to clear requirements and minimal decision-making."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Update ROLE entity class with navigation property",
      "complexityScore": 2,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 2,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the ROLE entity update into: 1) Adding the navigation property collection, and 2) Updating the constructor to initialize the collection properly",
      "reasoning": "This is a simple modification to an existing class, adding a single navigation property and initializing it. The code is provided and the changes are minimal with low risk of side effects."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Update DbContext configuration",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the DbContext update into: 1) Adding the DbSet property, 2) Configuring entity properties and constraints, and 3) Setting up the relationship with the ROLE entity",
      "reasoning": "This task involves more complexity as it requires configuring the entity in the DbContext, including setting up keys, required properties, and relationships. Errors here could affect database schema and application functionality."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Create OData entity model",
      "complexityScore": 3,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 2,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the OData entity creation into: 1) Creating the basic entity class with properties, and 2) Setting up the navigation property for the relationship with RoleEntity",
      "reasoning": "This task requires creating a separate model for OData operations with proper naming conventions. It's slightly more complex than the EF model due to the need to follow OData-specific patterns."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Create repository interface",
      "complexityScore": 3,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the repository interface creation into: 1) Defining basic CRUD operations, 2) Adding specialized query methods, and 3) Ensuring proper async patterns are followed",
      "reasoning": "Creating the interface requires defining the contract for all repository operations. While not technically difficult, it requires careful consideration of the methods needed for the application's requirements."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Implement repository class",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the repository implementation into: 1) Implementing query methods (GetAll, GetById, GetByRoleId), 2) Implementing Create method, 3) Implementing Update and Delete methods, and 4) Implementing utility methods like Exists",
      "reasoning": "This task has higher complexity as it involves implementing all the repository methods with proper database interactions, error handling, and business logic. The soft delete pattern adds additional complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Create controller with CRUD operations",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the controller implementation into: 1) Setting up the controller class with dependencies, 2) Implementing GET operations, 3) Implementing the custom GetByRoleId method, 4) Implementing POST and PUT operations, and 5) Implementing DELETE operation",
      "reasoning": "Controller implementation has high complexity due to the need to handle HTTP requests, map between entity types, implement proper OData routing, and handle various error conditions and status codes."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Update service registration",
      "complexityScore": 2,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 1,
      "expansionPrompt": "Implement the service registration by adding the repository to the dependency injection container in the appropriate configuration method",
      "reasoning": "This is a simple task involving a single line of code to register the repository in the DI container. The pattern is well-established and the risk is low."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Update EDM model registration",
      "complexityScore": 3,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 2,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the EDM registration into: 1) Registering the entity set in the OData model builder, and 2) Configuring the custom function for GetByRoleId",
      "reasoning": "This task involves configuring the OData EDM model with the new entity and function. While not highly complex, errors here could affect the OData API's functionality and discoverability."
