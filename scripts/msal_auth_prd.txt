# MSAL Authentication Integration for FourSPM_WebService

## Overview
This PRD outlines the implementation of Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) authentication in the FourSPM_WebService application while maintaining compatibility with legacy authentication methods. This dual-authentication approach will provide a smooth transition path for existing users while enabling new modern authentication features.

## Requirements

### Azure AD Configuration (Already Completed)
- Azure AD application registration is complete
- Application ID: c67bf91d-8b6a-494a-8b99-c7a4592e08c1
- Redirect URLs configured
- API scopes defined (Application.Admin and Application.User)
- Organization-only authentication enforced

### Authentication Implementation Requirements
1. Integrate Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) for modern authentication
2. Maintain compatibility with legacy authentication methods
3. Create middleware to handle both authentication types
4. Update JWT token validation to support MSAL tokens
5. Implement role-based authorization using existing ROLE and ROLE_PERMISSION tables
6. Configure JWT bearer options to support both auth methods
7. Create helper methods to validate token claims

### Specific Technical Requirements
1. Update Startup.cs to configure MSAL authentication alongside existing auth
2. Implement AuthService updates to support dual auth modes
3. Create MSAL-specific token validation logic
4. Update application user model to support new claims
5. Implement role and permission claim transformation
6. Configure proper authority and audience validation
7. Create documentation for auth flow and configuration

### Non-Requirements
1. Front-end implementation (will be handled separately)
2. Testing tasks (deferred until front-end is adjusted)

### Deliverables
1. Updated authentication middleware
2. Enhanced AuthService with MSAL support
3. Token validation and claim handling logic
4. Role-based authorization integration with MSAL
5. Configuration updates for dual authentication
